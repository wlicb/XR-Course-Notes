#### Week 2: Design Thinking, Ethics, and Guidelines for XR

1. Design Thinking:

   - Design Stages:

     a. Empathize

     - Can't just ask / observe: most people don't use XR frequently

     b. Define

     - Don't just commit to AR/VR

     c. Ideate

     - Ignore technical constraints

     d. Prototype

     - Focus on the unknowns

     e. Test

     - Act as wizard to fill the gaps

     f. Implement

     - Use the bet suited tools

   - Scenarios & Personas:

     a. Scenario Elements:

     - Setting: situation (state of the system, context of use) in which activity occurs.
     - Agent(s): people performing the activity described in scenario.
     - Goals: objectives agents are trying to accomplish.
     - Actions: activities that agents do to accomplish their goals.
     - Events: things that happen to users while doing the activities in the scenario.

     b. Personas: To represent different kinds of potential users.

     - Descriptions:

       ![](D:\UROP\2100\学习\Course 2\截图\微信截图_20210111095139.png)

     - Do's and Don'ts of Personas:

       (1) Do's:

       - Clarify how they were created.
       - Base them on data / facts.
       - Let them reflect your diverse target user groups.
       - Include negative personas to make it clear who you are not designing for (yet).

       (2) Don'ts:

       - Just make assumptions.
       - Stereotype personas.
       - Confuse negative personas with people you don't want to use your solution.

   - Competitive Analysis & Design Space Analysis:

     a. Competitors: 

     - Direct (Overlapping features/services/users)
     - Partial (Subset of features/services/users)
     - Indirect (Similar but in a different way)
     - Parallel (Similar but no direct competition)
     - Analogous (Non-competitor for inspiration).

     b. Competitive Analysis:

     - Include: Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats.
     - Don't try to include all features and do everything better. Rather, look for gaps.

     c. Design Space: 

     ​	Questions => Options => Criteria

   - Guiding Principles:

     a. Designer is not User.

     b. Hard to Unlearn.

     c. Be a Senior Designer: find path with different options in one stage and go forward/backward.

     d. Prototype is Product.

2. Design Ethics:

   a. Design Ethics Principles:

   - Autonomy: User is in control.
   - Transparency: User is informed about how to control.
   - Safety: User is protected from danger, risk and injury.

   b. Ethical Review:

   - Define Purpose, Procedure, Duration
   - Maximize Benefits / Limit Trade-offs.
   - Minimize Risks.
   - Empower Participants (How to enable users to stay in control)

   c. Design Ethics Review:

   - Context & Situation:

     Where is the XR device being used? 

     Who is around the user?

   - Sensory Information & Data:

     What does the XR device see?

     What kind of data is acquired?

   - Processing Pipeline:

     What happens on-device?

     What happens in the cloud?

   - Data Ownership & Governance:

     Who owns and manages the data? 

     How is the user informed?

   d. Design Impact:

   - Before: set expectations of users for new reality.
   - During: balance realism, comfort and safety.
   - After: help users transition back to old reality.

   e. Keep in Mind:

   - Consider the cost-benefit ratio.
   - Stay aware (always learn).
   - Be honest (know the tech).

3. Design Guidelines:

   a. Existing Design Guidelines:

   - By Vendors (Platform driven): Oculus, Google, Mozilla. 
   - By Designers (User oriented)
   - By Practitioners (Experience based)
   - By Researchers (Empirically derived)

   b. Troubles with Design Guidelines:

   - Rapidly evolving best practices: 

     Still a moving target, lots to learn about XR design.

     Slowly emerging design patterns, but often change with OS updates.

     Already major differences between device platforms.

   - Challenges with scoping guidelines: 

     Often too high level, like "keep the user safe and comfortable" or too application/device/vendor-specific.

   - Best guidelines come from learning by doing:

     Test your designs early and often, learn from your own "mistakes". Mind differences between VR and AR, but less so between devices.

   c. Do's and Don't of XR Design:

   - Do's:
     - Offer alternative ways to travel.
     - Use interface metaphors. (An interface metaphor is a set of user interface visuals, actions and procedures that exploit specific knowledge that users already have of other domains)
     - Use physical affordances. (Physical affordance is a design feature that helps, aids, supports, facilitates, or enables doing something physically)
     - Minimize explicit interactions.
     - Put important elements in the foreground, avoid periphery.
     - Provide visual and audio cues to guide the users through tasks.
   - Don'ts:
     - Move user without their input.
     - Reinvent reality. 
     - Just copy/paste real world.
     - Rely on gestures or speech.
     - Have users read a lot of text.
     - Put lots of content in the HUD.
     - Remap controller buttons, break conventions.

4. Design Jams:

   a. Different people gather together to design.

   b. Things to think about:

   ​	Goals, Tasks, Deliverables, Devices, Tools, Time.

   c. Planning Design Jams:

   - Start by thinking about who should participate.
   - What happens before and after the design jam? (pre and post task, data to collect about participants)
   - Make sure everyone is on the same page. (demo, reference)
   - Organize all the materials.

   d. Running Design Jams:

   - Give the problem statement.
   - Have a clear design prompt.
   - Use a consistent structure. (start with a goal, provide a description of each task and specify deliverables)
   - Collect feedback.
   - Have clear roles assigned in your team (keeping time, answering questions, taking notes)
   - Do a dry-run.

   e. Participating in Design Jams:

   - Making a plan is crucial.
   - Sketch to brainstorm.
   - Make use of space.
   - Divide workload.
   - Key deliverables: Scenarios, personas, competitor (inspiration), user flows & wireframes, physical / digital prototype, video.
   - Alternative designs: Document design evolution as much as possible.
   - Practice and solicit feedback from others. 

   f. Things you could/should do:

   - Mini project plan (define approach, milestones and roles)
   - Scenarios (spell out settings, agents and activities)
   - Personas (communicate who you are designing for and who not)
   - Storyboards (use AR/VR templates, flesh out promising ideas)
   - Physical prototypes (demo envisioned interface and interactions)
   - Digital prototypes (implement and test key aspects)

5. Design Critiques:

   a. I like / I wish / What if Template:

   - I like: What you like about it.
   - I wish: What could be improved.
   - What if: How could it be improved.

   b. Keep in mind:

   - Design guidelines: Feedback, affordances, mappings, constraints.
   - Usability: Learnability, memorability, efficiency, errors, satisfaction.
   - Accessibility and equity
   - Audience and personal experience
   - Concerns and impact: Physical, mental, privacy, social, cultural, environmental, ...



#### Week 3: Storyboarding & Physical Prototyping for XR Experiences

1. Brainstorming and Problem Framing:

   a. Ideate-Implement-Inspect-Iterate Design Cycle

   b. "Killer-App" Problem:

   - Novelty is not Creativity.

   - Find key app and improve it in one way.

   c. Problem-Promise-Premise Approach:

   - What is the problem tackled by your XR solution? (importance)
   - What is the promise of your XR solution? (value proposition)
   - What is the premise of your XR solution? (assumption)

   d. Write the Intro First Approach:

   - Introduction: problem (in general), obstacle (specifically), solution (in essence), contribution (scientifically). 

   e. Idea Hexagon

   <img src="D:\UROP\2100\学习\Course 2\截图\微信截图_20210111202614.png" style="zoom:50%;" />

   g. Threshold & Ceiling in Tool Design:

   - Threshold: all the members need to learn about the tool.
   - Ceiling: the most that can be done with the tool.

2. Good Ideas and Bad Ideas in XR Innovation:

   a. Good Ideas:

   - You are adding a significant new feature to an existing solution.
   - You are doing a redesign of part of an existing solution.
   - You are picking one particular aspect of a problem and try a different solution.
   - You are looking at an existing problem through a new lens.

   b. Bad Ideas:

   - You are just adding a small new feature to an existing solution.
   - You are trying to make an existing solution "much better".
   - You are trying to do what multiple existing solutions do in one new solution.
   - You are trying to do what nobody else has done before.

3. Storyboarding & Wireframing:

   <img src="D:\UROP\2100\学习\Course 2\截图\微信截图_20210111205710.png" style="zoom:50%;" />

   - Traditional storyboards: organize 2D screens, limited for 3D scenes.
   - 360 storyboards: spatial content layout around the user, no depth.
   - 3D sketches: detailed content around the user, in 3D space.

4. Physical Prototyping:

   <img src="D:\UROP\2100\学习\Course 2\截图\微信图片_20210111215414.png" style="zoom:50%;" />

   - Put objects on cardboard sticks or toothpicks to animate them.

   b. 360 paper prototypes:
   
   - Lay out content 360 degrees around the user.
- Demonstrate interactions along the gird lines.
   - Use objects of different size to simulate depth.

   c. Diorama:
   
   - Enact the 3D scene in the physical world.
- Play out the 3D characters in response to user interactions.
   - Gauge spatial requirements and understand relationships.

      A good task: 

      - based on a goal that matters to you and the users.
      - based on questions important to the success of the product or research.
      - not too broad or too narrow.
      - finite and predictable set of possible solutions.
      - clear end point that user can recognize and reach.
      - looking for actionable feedback and not just opinion.

      A bad task:

      - no real task.
      - looks to confirm rather than test your design choice.
      - too vague.
      - too small/short.
      - only involves trivial interactions.
      - uses exact labels from interface.
